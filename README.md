%-------------------------- Convex programming for GME-dimension --------------------------%

Detecting, quantifying and characterising relevant forms of entanglement is of central interest in quantum information science. 
In recent years, high-dimensional systems have emerged as a major frontier for entanglement. In bipartite systems, entanglement has been 
detected far beyond qubit dimensions but the high-dimensional multipartite regime is more challenging. We propose to quantify the genuine
multipartite entanglement dimension via the worst-case Schmidt number needed to generate the state by classically mixing entangled states
over different cuts of the system.<br />
Here we detect this form of entanglement by convex programming methods as proposed in [1].<br />
In particular, in this repository we provide the functions needed to evaluate the linear programs when the pure target state is:
- n-partite high-dimensional GHZ state;
- n-partite high-dimensional linear cluster state.

%-------------------------- List of the functions --------------------------%

- Cluster_state-LP
  - LPGMENmixercl.m <br />
    This function evaluates the LP (YALMIP) with a pure linear cluster state and finds the maximum visibility to have a specific GME-dimension
    
  - kpositivecluster.m <br />
    This function applies the k-positive generalised reduction map on a density matrix diagonal in the graph basis
    
  - Stirling2nd.m [2]
  - SetPartition.m [2]
 
- GHZ_state-LP
  - LPGMENmixerghz.m <br />
    This function evaluates the LP (YALMIP) with a pure n-partite high-dimensional GHZ state and finds the maximum visibility to have a specific
    GME-dimension
    
  - kpositiveghz.m <br />
    This function applies the k-positive generalised reduction map on a density matrix diagonal in the GHZ basis
    
  - Stirling2dn.m [2]
  - SetPartition.m [2]
